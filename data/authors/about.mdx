Who am I?

# Currently working on

The 9 till 5 project @ [Experience Digital](https://experience.digital)

# What I use

## Editor

<ul>
  <li>
    The blazingly üî• fast [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) editor with some notable
    [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) extensions that make it a personal development
    environment include
  </li>
  <li>
    language [native LSP support](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and
    [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) which can quickly manage them in addition to
    Linters, Debug adapters and formatters.
  </li>
  <li>
    debugging via [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and
    [nvim-dap-ui](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) with some fancy [virtual
    text](https://github.com/theHamsta/nvim-dap-virtual-text)
  </li>
  <li>
    search and so much more via [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) with a
    special mention to my [harpooning](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) friend

</ul>

Most of the apps I use are web based, but I do have a few desktop apps that I use on a daily basis.

  </li>
  <li>[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/ph-en/) for music.</li>
</ul>
