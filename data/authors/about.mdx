Who am I?

# Currently working on

The 9 till 5 project @ [8seats](https://8seats.com)

# What I use

## Editor

<ul>
  <li>
    The blazingly üî• fast [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) editor with some notable
    [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) extensions that make it a personal development
    environment include
  </li>
  <li>
    language [native LSP support](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and
    [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) which can quickly manage them in addition to
    Linters, Debug adapters and formatters.
  </li>

    debugging via [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and
    [nvim-dap-ui](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) with some fancy [virtual

Most of the apps I use are web based, but I do have a few desktop apps that I use on a daily basis. I feel that we move more towards web based applications. Here's a few desktop and stickied web apps.

<ul>

  <li>[Github](https://github.com) Professional and personal cloud repo, ci and collab.</li>

    syncing multi devices.
  </li>
  <li>[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) Tunnels for reverse proxy things.</li>
  <li>[Youtube](https://youtube.com) Music mostly.</li>
  <li>[Open UI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) For Ollama.</li>
